# Shifts Logger

**Shifts Logger** is a two-part application: a **.NET Web API** and an interactive **console app** for managing employee work shifts.

The project is built using **.NET 8**, **Entity Framework Core (Code-First)**, **SQL Server**, and a **Spectre.Console** UI for a polished terminal experience. It's designed to help you understand how to build and consume APIs, handle user input, and structure real-world apps.
